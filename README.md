# NYC CitiBike

## Overview

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to create a data visualization with Tableau for bike sharing program in New York City.

- Starting with only a .csv file, we can create a visual story for audiences to absorb with clear graphics and informative text.

- With this, one could easily create a business proposal substantiated by our data.

The Tableau story of the NYC CitiBike can be found in the following link:
